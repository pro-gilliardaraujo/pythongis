# Language Consistency Rule

1.  **Identify Language**: Always identify the language used by the user in their current prompt.
2.  **Respond in Kind**: ensure all explanations, summaries, and chat responses are in the identified language.
3.  **Artifacts & Plans**: All artifacts (Implementation Plans, Task Lists, etc.) MUST be written in the same language as the conversation.
4.  **Persistence**: Apply this rule to every turn in the conversation.
